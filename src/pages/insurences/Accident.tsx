Individual accident insurance is a crucial safeguard against the unexpected, providing individuals with financial protection in the event of accidents resulting in injuries or disabilities. This insurance coverage is designed to offer peace of mind by providing benefits tailored to address specific needs. Typically, individual accident insurance policies cover medical expenses incurred due to accidents, including hospitalization, surgery, and rehabilitation costs. Additionally, they may offer benefits such as income replacement for lost wages during recovery, coverage for accidental death or dismemberment, and reimbursement for transportation and lodging expenses related to medical treatment.
